# Welcome to the CloudBlue Connect Customer Email Notifications extension!

Overview
## About Email Platform
Email is the most used communication system. With email, you can send messages, photos, videos, and files of any type (doc, zip, mp3, etc).

## Connect Customer Email Notification Extension
The **Email Notification Extension** allows sending a customized email to your customer when a new Subscription is activated.
If you are a Distributor or a Reseller, you can configure per product sending rules, and when a Subscription for such a product is activated, the extension sends an email to the customer contact using the template associated with the **rule** and your brand contact as the sender account.

With this extension, you can:
- Create templates customized by product
- Enable and disable rules very easily
- Include subscription metadata as
    - Customer name
    - Asset ID
- Include subscription metadata blocks as 
    - Items
    - Parameters
- Include links and images
- See the date that the email was sent 
- See a copy of the content of the email  that was sent 

Once the extension is installed, you will need to create product rules. For that, go to the main page of the extension, where you will find an intuitive rule administrator.
